Traditionally, the two effects of an accounting entry are known as Debit (Dr) and Credit (Cr). 
Accounting system is based on the principal that for every Debit entry, there will always be an 
equal Credit entry. This is known as the Duality Principal.

Debit refers to the left side of an account.
Credit refers to the right side of an account.

Debit entries are ones that account for the following effects:

    Increase in assets
    Increase in expense
    Decrease in liability
    Decrease in equity
    Decrease in income

Credit entries are ones that account for the following effects:

    Decrease in assets
    Decrease in expense
    Increase in liability
    Increase in equity
    Increase in income

Double Entry is recorded in a manner that the Accounting Equation is always in balance.

Assets - Liabilities = Capital

Any increase in expense (Dr) will be offset by a decrease in assets (Cr) or increase in liability 
or equity (Cr) and vice-versa. Hence, the accounting equation will still be in equilibrium.

  With sophisticated accounting software and inexpensive computers, it is no longer practical for most 
  businesses to manually enter transactions into journals and then to post to the *general ledger* accounts 
  and *subsidiary* ledger accounts.
